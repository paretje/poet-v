INTRODUCTION                                                      *poet-v* *poetv*

Poet-v is a vim/nvim plugin that detects and activates virtual environments in
your python <poetry>{https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry} or
<pipenv>{https://github.com/pypa/pipenv} project.

It is inspired (and closely resembles) both
<vim-virtualenv>{https://github.com/jmcantrell/vim-virtualenv} and its pipenv
spin-off <vim-pipenv>{https://github.com/PieterjanMontens/vim-pipenv}. However
it also adds the ability to interact with virtual environments created by poetry
and integrates nicely with <jedi-vim>{https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim}
(and <deoplete-jedi>{https://github.com/deoplete-plugins/deoplete-jedi}).


COMMANDS                                                        *poetv-commands*

:PoetvActivate                                                  *:PoetvActivate*
    activates the corresponding poetry or pipenv venv (see |g:poetv_executables|
    for details regarding order) and enforces jedi (and deoplete-jedi) to use it
    (if <jedi-vim>/<deoplete-jedi> is installed).

:PoetvDectivate                                               *:PoetvDeactivate*
    deactivates the current venv.

There is also a function, `poetv#statusline()`, that retrieves the current venv
name (it's used by poet-v to provide out of the box integration with
{vim-airline}{https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline}).
